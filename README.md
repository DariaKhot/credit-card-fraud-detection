## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on detecting **fraudulent credit card transactions** using machine learning algorithms.  
By analyzing transaction data, the goal is to **identify patterns and behaviors indicative of fraud**, while tackling the challenge of **highly imbalanced datasets**.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**, specifically the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
- 📅 Transactions from **September 2013** by European cardholders  
- 🔢 **284,807** transactions, of which only **492 are frauds** (0.172%)  
- ⚙️ Numerical features obtained from **PCA transformation**  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Highly **imbalanced data**  
- Fraudulent transactions represent a **minority class**  
- Data requires **resampling strategies** to balance
